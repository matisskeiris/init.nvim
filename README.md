# init.nvim

My personal NVIM init.lua

Configured with base LSP, Treesitter and Telescope. Using kanagawa theme.

# setup

Install NeoVIM. 
Add this to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/nvim`. 
Start nvim

# TODO

This is initial NeoVIM config for personal usage. Currently learning to use vim as my primary editor, playing around and getting familiar with LUA configuration and VIM motions. 

Here is a list of currently known wants from my side:

* Set up DAP
* Better LSP shortcuts
* Git integration
